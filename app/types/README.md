# Type conversion

- This dir is about sanitize our obj and replace the prop types with the prop/accepted ones (type sanitization)
- as we know some of the current user field are date str
- other than text when we pass the obj thru wire it will give warnig, inorder to get rid of that lets type cast those fields
- and create a safe user, listing with the type casted fields
